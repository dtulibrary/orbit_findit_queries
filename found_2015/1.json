For the past twelve years he has progressively taken up energy studies. While continuing as an energy practitioner through consultancy and project planning and implementation, he has been pursuing academic work. Focus of his activities has been sustainable energy and rural development in Kenya and East African countries. For five years he was in Denmark where he continued with the Africa focused work with a European perspective. He embarked on full research work in Denmark, and currently he is pursuing a sandwich PhD programme at the University of Twente; A. major part of the doctoral work is in Kenya, where he is carrying out field studies.","Dr Hans Bressers (1953) is professor of Policy Studies and Environmental Policy at the University of Twente in the Netherlands and founder of CSTM. Currently he is an independent scientific member of the Commission on Sustainable development of the Dutch Social-Economic Council (SER). In over two hundred articles, chapters, reports, papers and books (both in Dutch and in English) he published on policy-mapping, -instruments, -implementation, -evaluation and policy networks, mostly applied on environmental policies and water management. He has been researcher and project leader of numerous externally funded projects, including several projects funded by EU research frameworks, Dutch national science foundation, Dutch ministries, etceteras.","Dr Joy Clancy is a Reader (Associate Professor) in Development Studies specializing in Technology Transfer. She joined the Technology and Development Group, part of which has been amalgamated into CSTM, in 1989. Dr Clancy's research has focused, for more than 25 years, on small scale energy systems for developing countries, including the technology transfer process and the role that energy plays as an input for small businesses and the potential it offers entrepreneurs through the provision of a new infrastructure service. Gender and energy has been an important factor addressed in this research. Recently she has been working on social inclusion and exclusion in biofuel value chains and the impacts on poverty. She is a founder member of ENERGIA, the international network on Gender. Dr Clancy is also a co-convenor of the Gender and Development Working Group of the European Association of Development and Training Institutes (EADI). Dr Clancy is currently a technical advisor on gender and energy to the World Bank AFREA Programme. She is currently a member of the Dutch Ministry for Development Cooperation's (DGIS) knowledge panel on sustainability, climate and
